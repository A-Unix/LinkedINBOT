## Usage Disclaimer
Please note that automated data scraping, even with permissions, can still raise ethical and legal concerns, and it's important to respect the privacy and terms of service of the platforms you are interacting with.

If you have explicit permissions from LinkedIn, I would recommend reviewing their API documentation, as they provide official ways to access certain data in a way that aligns with their terms of service instead of using this bot. Using the API is often a more ethical and reliable method compared to web scraping. I'm not responsible for how you use this tool, it is solely your own responsibility to use it in an ethical way.
